                  Blockchain Based Voting System
Project Overview
 This project is a Blockchain Based Voting System designed to provide a secure, transparent, and
 tamper-proof online voting platform.It ensures that only eligible voters can vote and that each
 voter can cast only one vote, while all votes are stored securely using blockchain technology.

 Problem Statement

Traditional voting systems face issues such as:
Vote tampering
Lack of transparency
Duplicate or fake voting
Manual counting errors
This project solves these problems by using blockchain, where once a vote is recorded,
it cannot be altered or deleted.
